# Indoor solution

I developed my own proof-of-concept project, Indoor Solution, for measuring carbon dioxide and temperature levels in an apartment, using an LED strip as an indicator. It was implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller with its native IDF SDK and C language. <br>
<br>The project uses the following technologies:
- Wifi
- Http Post request
- Bluetooth classic

Sensors:<br>
- MHZ19B(UART)
- BME680(I2C)
- DS3231(I2C)
- HDC1080(I2C)
- CCS811(I2C)
